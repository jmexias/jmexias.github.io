The Travel Cost Travel Cost Estimate calculator is an excel spreadsheet that I developed and managed in order to request funding to plan, prepare, and execute collaboration events between U.S. Army units and partner nations. The spreadsheet uses several different formulas that are able to be edited based on the location travel is happening, what the current allowable costs would be, and estimates total cost based on user input factors such as current plane ticket costs, average hotel rates, and other allowable expenses. The spreadsheet would go on to assist in the development of future software intended to better integrate the resource request process into the U.S. Army networking systems.
