I served as the Integrated Joint Fires Center (IJFC) subject matter expert for the Joint Warfighter Experiment (JWX) in Suffolk, VA from 10 September 2023 - 22 September 2023. I played an integral role in a combined & joint experiment that informed the development of the Joint Fires Network for the USINDOPACOM Commander. Some of these contributions introduced new ways to enhance new technologies & tools, as well as led an accelerated joint tasking order cycle, integrating multi-service options within an area of responsibility.
